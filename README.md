# Music Recommendation Engine

This project is a demo music recommendation engine that uses **K-Means clustering**
to group and recommend songs based on numerical audio features.  
It addresses the **cold-start problem** by relying on feature-based similarity
rather than user listening history.

## Features
- Feature-based music recommendations
- K-Means clustering for grouping similar songs
- Cold-start friendly approach
- Frontend + backend working together
- Modular design, easy to extend

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: JavaScript (React)
- Backend: Python (Django)
- Machine Learning: Python, scikit-learn
- Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
